# `jsontp/lib/rust`
- this is the rust implementation of the jsontp library
- it aims to be a 1:1 implementation of the jsontp library in rust
- it will eventually be the gold standard reference implementation for the jsontp library, fully compliant and compatible with the spec
- it implements a "`Builder`-style" client interface, and a similar route-based server interface, not dissimilar to Python's `Flask` library, which I am personally quite fond of
